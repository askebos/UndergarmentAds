Archival work is never conducted alone, and so I also thank the archivists and keepers of the [Smithsonian National Museum of American History](https://sova.si.edu//details/NMAH.AC.0585), the librarians at [The Sainsbury Library](https://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/business) who provided access to ProQuest databases, the librarians at the [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/) who helped locate elusive magazine issues, and Jodynn who helped scavenge and annotate _Mademoiselle_ issues available at the [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/).
